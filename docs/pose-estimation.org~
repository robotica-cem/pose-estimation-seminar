** Why do we calibrate IMUs?
   - Must relate what we measure (e.g. Voltage) to real physical quantity (e.g. acceleration) 
   - Unknown sensitivity (gain) \[\underbrace{y_m}_{\text{measurement}} = \underbrace{a_y}_{\text{gain}} \cdot  \underbrace{y_0}_{\text{true quantity}} \]
   - Offset (bias) in measurement
     \[y_m = a_y y_0 + \underbrace{b_y}_{\text{bias}}\]
   - Misalignment between sensor axes leading to cross talk
     \[ y_m = a_y  y_0 + b_y  + c_{yx} x_0 + b_x + c_{yz}  z_0 + b_z  \]
   - Calibration by manufacturer often not accurate enough, or parameters change with time and/or working condition (temparature)

** Main idea behind calibration
   - Formulate model that describes the relationship between the physical quantity and the measurement 
     \[ y_m = f(y_0; \theta) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{y}_0 = f^{-1}(y_m; \theta)   \]
   - Determine the parameters \(\theta\) of the model from measurements with known values of the physical quantities 
     \[ \theta = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; g(\hat{y}_0, y_0; \theta) \]
     where $g$ is an error function that quantifies the discrepency between model value and true value  
** External- vs self-calibration
   - External calibration referes to the use of some external device to generate known physical quantities
   - Self-calibration refers to the use of the sensor-node's own sensors to calibrate. Some known physical quantity still needed (like gravitational acceleration).
   - In this seminar we will focus on self-calibration of accelerometers without the need for expensive external equipment.
** Gyro
   - Known, or measurable change in orientation must be applied to the sensor
   - Self-calibration can be done using on-sensor-node camera[fn:1]
** Magnetometer
   - Self-calibration can be performed assuming constant magnetic field and tracking the change in orientation of the sensor node (using gyro and/or camera)[fn:2]
** Calibrating accelerometers
   - The external reference used is the gravitational acceleration 
   - When the sensor is in rest, the accelerometer measures the gravitational acceleration.
   - The magnitude of the gravitational acceleration varies with location and with time
     - Mexico City: \unit{9.779}{\metre\per\second\squared}
     - Stockholm: \unit{9.818}{\metre\per\second\squared}
   - The international gravity formula:
     \begin{equation*}
     \begin{split}
      g = & 9.7803327 \Big(1 + 5.3024\cdot 10^{-3} \sin^2(\theta)  - 5.8 \cdot 10^{-6} \sin^2(2\theta) \Big)\\
          & \; - 3.086 \cdot 10^{-6} h 
     \end{split}
     \end{equation}

* Self-calibration of accelerometers
** Signal models for acceleration
   - The basic model of acceleration measurements is
     \[ a_m = D a_0 + b + n, \]
   - The \(3\times 3\) calibration matrix $D$ can have different structures
     - Diagonal 
     - Symmetric
     - General
   - \(b\) is a bias
   - \(n\) is a measurement noise
   - The parameters in the model are the elements of \(D\) and \(b\)
** Straight forward estimation method
   - Assume $N$ measurements \[ \{a_{m,k}, \, k=1,2,\ldots, N\} \] with known external acceleration
     \[ \{a_{0,k}, \, k=1,2,\ldots, N\} \]
   - Find the parameters \(D\) and \(b\) in the measurement model that minimizes the sum of squared residuals
     \[ \hat{\theta}_{LS} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}}  \; \sum_{k=1}^N \left(a_{m,k} - Da_0 - b\right)^2 \]
   - This is called least squares estimation
** Maximum likelihood
   - The measurement \(a_m = D a_0 + b + n\) depends on a random variable \(n\). This means that the measurement is also random variable.
   - Since \(a_m\) is the sum of deterministic terms and a single random variable, it has the same variance as the random variable, but different mean
   - Write the /probability density function/ (pdf) of \(a_m\) as \[f(a_m;\, \theta, a_0),\] where \(\theta\) is the vector of parameters in the measurement model.
   - The /likelihood/ function is a function of \(\theta\). It describes how likely the parameter \(\theta\) is, /given the data/. Formally, it is the same function as the pdf, but with the role of \(a_m\) and \(\theta\) reversed:
     \[ L(\theta ;\, a_m, a_0) = f(\a_m;\, \theta, a_0) \]
** Maximum likelihood estimation
    The maximum likelihood estimation of \(\theta\) is the value of \(\theta\) which maximizes the likelihood function
    \[ \hat{\theta}_{ML} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} \; L(\theta ;\, a_m, a_0). \]

    Often it is more convenient to maximize the /logarithm/ of the likelihood function
    \[ l(\theta ;\, a_m, a_0) = \log L(\theta ;\, a_m, a_0). \]

** Maximum likelihood - gaussian noise
   - If the measurement noise \(n\) is zero-mean gaussian, 
     \(\mathcal{N}(0, S) \) then the mean of the measurement is \(\bar{a}_m = Da_0+b \) and the covariance is $S$.
   - The pdf of the measurement is
     \[ f(a_m;\, \theta, a_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^3|S|}} \exp\Big(-\frac{1}{2}(a_m-Da_0-b)\transp S^{-1} (a_m-Da_0-b)\Big) \]
   - This is the same as the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function becomes
     \[ l(\theta) = -\frac{3}{2}\log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2}\log |S| - \frac{1}{2}(a_m-Da_0-b)\transp S^{-1} (a_m-Da_0-b) \]
   - The first two terms do not depend on $\theta$, so the ML estimate becomes
     \[ \hat{\theta}_{ML} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; \frac{1}{2}(a_m-Da_0-b)\transp S^{-1} (a_m-Da_0-b) \]


** Maximum likelihood - several measurements
   - Need the joint pdf of all the measurements \( a_{m,k},\; k=1,2,\ldots, N \)
     \[ f(a_{m,1}, a_{m,2}, \ldots, a_{m,N};\, \theta ). \] 
   - Assume independent measurement noise then
     \[ f(a_{m,1}, a_{m,2}, \ldots, a_{m,N};\, \theta) = f_1(a_{m,1};\, \theta)f_2(a_{m,2};\, \theta)\cdots f_N(a_{m,N};\, \theta). \]
   - The log-likelihood function becomes
     \[ l(\theta) = \log f_1(a_{m,1};\, \theta) + \log f_2(a_{m,2};\, \theta) + \cdots + \log f_N(a_{m,N};\, \theta) \]

** Maximum likelihood - several measurements - IID gaussian
   It is common to assume independent and identical distributed measurement noise. This gives the maximum likelihood estimation problem
   
   \[ \hat{\theta}_{ML} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^N (a_{m,k}-Da_{0,k}-b)\transp S^{-1} (a_{m,k}-Da_{0,k}-b) \]
   
   Recall Least Squares estimate
     \[ \hat{\theta}_{LS} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}}  \; \sum_{k=1}^N \left(a_{m,k} - Da_0 - b\right)^2 \]

** To remember
   \[
   \text{Weighted least squares} = \text{maximum likelihood} \]
   under the assumption of additive gaussian noise

* Frosio et al 
** What if the direction of the true acceleration is not known?
   - Without an external apparatus, it is not possible to know the directon of the true acceleration \(a_0\) in the reference frame of the sensor.
   - On the other hand, if the sensor is in rest wrt earth, then the magnitude \(||a_0||=g\) is known to good accuracy for different locations on earth.
   - Find calibration parameters by minimizing squared difference between the magnitude of the acceleration estimated from the measurements 
     \[ a_n = D^{-1}(a_m - b) \]
     and the gravitational acceleration \(g\).
   - Estimation problem
     \begin{equation} \hat{\theta}_{NLS} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; \sum_{k=1}^N \left( ||a_{n,k}||^2 - g^2 \right)^2 
     \label{eq:frosio}
     \end{equation}
  
** Frosio et al

   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{frosio-title.png}
   \end{center}

   - Show that \( ||a_{n,k}||^2 \) can be approximated by the sum of a deterministic and a gaussian term.
   - The (nonlinear) LS estimate \eqref{eq:frosio} is then also the ML estimate.
   - The likelihood function can be used to determine suitable model order
     - 6, 9 or 12 parameters
     - Aikaikes Information Criterion

** Nonlinear least squares
   - The problem 
     \[ \hat{\theta}_{NLS} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; \sum_{k=1}^N \left( ||a_{n,k}||^2 - g^2 \right)^2 \]
   
     is *not* linear in the variables $\theta$.

   - Iterative solution needed.

   - Implemented in matlab's =lsqnonlin= function

   - Multiple solutions (local minima)

     - Need to start close to true values

     - Use factory calibration of sensor as starting point
